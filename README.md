# Sass Build Starter Template

This starter template frames out a modular Sass build environment based on architectdure recommendations from the [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/). These recommendations are an extension of [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/).

## Recommended VS Code Extensions

* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to help maintain consistent formatting.

* [Stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint) for code analysis to comply with recommended best practices.

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Getting Started

These steps will allow you to jump right in and fire up the dev server.

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into the root directory
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`

A browser instance should automatically open, but if not, you can access
the live server at http://localhost:3000.

## Commands

* `npm run build` will build your production-ready stylesheet to the `dist` directory.
* `npm run lint` will check your code for code style and best practices.
* `npm run lint:fix` will lint your code and apply automatic fixes when possible.
